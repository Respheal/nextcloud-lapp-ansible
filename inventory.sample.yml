# inventory.yml
#
# This file is used by Ansible to define the hosts that the playbook
# will perform actions on. Below is the sample inventory provided by
# this playbook which includes inline comments clarifying each section
# and the items contained within it.
#
# For additional information, please see the following:

# The 'nextcloud' group contains the variables and hosts that will be
# used by the playbook to deploy Nextcloud.
nextcloud:
  # Within the 'nextcloud' group we may define 'vars' that act as
  # settings that apply to all 'hosts' defined in this group.
  vars:
    # When enabled, 'use_letsencrypt' signals to generate a Let's Encrypt
    # SSL certificate as part of the deployment. This is disabled by default
    # to prevent a host from being ratelimited by the Let's Encrypt API,
    # though additional conditions have been added to ensure that a
    # host meets the needed conditions to generate an SSL.
    #
    # You may freely enable/disable this variable to control whether a
    # target site should use HTTP or HTTPS after running this playbook.
    use_letsencrypt: false

    # When enabled, Ansible will determine if the host supports Redis
    # (Requirement: > 1GB Memory). If Redis is supported, it will be
    # installed and Nextcloud will be configured to make use of Redis caching
    use_redis: true

  # Within the 'nextcloud' group we may define 'hosts' that indicate
  # the individual deployment targets for this playbook.
  hosts:
    # Within 'hosts' we may define an individual host, referenced in
    # this example as 'domain.tld'. This may be either a domain name
    # or IP address, based on your preference, provided it is able to
    # be reached.
    domain.tld:

      # 'system_user' refers to the Linux system user that the
      # Nextcloud installation will be owned by and created under
      # this user's '~/doc_root' directory.
      system_user: "nextcloud"

      # The domain associated with the Nextcloud installation. Simply
      # use the domain name itself without defining a protocol or
      # trailing '/' characters.
      site_domain: "domain.tld"

      # The username of the Nextcloud administrator.
      site_user: "example_username" # INSECURE!! CHANGEME!!

      # The password of the Nextcloud administrator.
      site_pass: "example_password" # INSECURE!! CHANGEME!!

      # The email address for Let's Encrypt certification activation.
      # Required if use_letsencrypt: true
      site_email: "user@domain.tld"

      # (Advanced Configuration) Object Storage
      # Nextcloud supports using OpenStack's Swift or any compatible S3
      # implementation as primary storage instead of the default
      # on-server data directory.
      # The following options are for storage configuration.
      # See https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/15/admin_manual/configuration_files/primary_storage.html
      # for more information.
